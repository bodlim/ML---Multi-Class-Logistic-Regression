# ML---Multi-Class-Logistic-Regression

This repository is in fulfillment of the Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Andrew Ng.

ex3.m involves the implementation of multi class logistic regression for recognizing handwritten digits (from 0 to 9). Related applications include the recognitions of handwritten zip codes on mail envelopes and amounts written on bank checks. 

ex3data1 contains 5000 training examples, each of which is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of a digit. This 20 by 20 grid of pixels is unrolled into a 400-dimensional vector. NB: "each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location"
